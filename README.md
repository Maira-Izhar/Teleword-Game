# Teleword-Game
This is my first C++ project. Its a game called Teleword. This game requires a text file containing a grid of specific alphabets that make up different words in all directions. The code helps the user to identify all words listed. The characters left at the end represent another word called Teleword.
# Compiler
This was built and tested on Visual Studio 2022.
